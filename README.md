# Machine-Learning---Deliverables---Mohammed-Abdur-Rasheed

Welcome to the repository for "Year of Graduation Data" and "Prediction of Placement Status Data," along with project documents and an app demo video. This repository contains the necessary data, documentation, and resources for these two problem statements.

# Problem Statement 1 - Year of Graduation Data

This section contains data and related resources for Problem Statement 1, which focuses on Year of Graduation data. Here's what you will find:

# Overview

The **Calculation for Year of Graduation** project is a data analysis project aimed at calculating the year of graduation for a group of individuals based on certain criteria. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for using it, and details about the provided files.

# Files in this Repository

1. **Calculation for Year of Graduation.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for data analysis and the calculation of the year of graduation. It's where you can see the logic and calculations applied to the data.

1. **Calculation for Year of Graduation.xlsx:** This Excel file likely contains the dataset used for the calculations. It may contain multiple sheets, each with data relevant to the year of graduation calculation.

1. **Final Lead Data.xlsx:** This Excel file probably contains the final results or lead data, including the calculated year of graduation for each individual.

# How to Use

To use this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning---Deliverables---Mohammed-Abdur-Rasheed.git
   
1. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebook **(Calculation for Year of Graduation.ipynb)** to understand how the calculations for the year of graduation are performed. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.

1. **Review the Data:** Examine the provided Excel files **(Calculation for Year of Graduation.xlsx and Final Lead Data.xlsx)** to understand the structure and content of the dataset. This will help you understand the input data and the results of the year of graduation calculation.

1. **Modify and Extend:** If needed, you can modify the Jupyter Notebook to adapt the calculations for different datasets or criteria. You can also use the code as a reference for similar calculations in other projects.

# Dataset Information

The dataset **(Calculation for Year of Graduation.xlsx)** likely contains information about individuals and the criteria used to calculate their year of graduation. Common columns might include:

* ID
* Frist Name
* Email
* New College Name
* Academic Year
* What is your current academic year?
* Graduation Year (Output Variable)

Ensure that you understand the meaning of each column in the dataset before working with it.
  
# Problem Statement 2 - Prediction of Placement Status Data

This section contains data and related resources for Problem Statement 2, which focuses on the Prediction of Placement Status. Here's what you will find:

# Overview

The **Prediction of Placement Status** project is a data analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at predicting whether students will be placed in a job or not based on various factors. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for using it, and details about the dataset.

# Files in this Repository

1. **Prediction of Placement Status.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for data analysis, modeling, and predictions. It's the heart of the project where you can see how the data is explored, models are trained, and predictions are made.

1. **Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx:** This Excel file likely contains the cleaned and preprocessed data used for analysis and modeling. It might have multiple sheets, including one for training data and possibly another for testing data.

1. **Train Data.xlsx:** This Excel file is likely a subset of the main dataset containing only the training data used to train and validate machine learning models.

1. **Test Data.xlsx:** This Excel file likely contains data used for testing the trained models. It's often used to assess the model's predictive performance on unseen data.

# How to Use

To use this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning---Deliverables---Mohammed-Abdur-Rasheed.git`

1. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebook **(Prediction of Placement Status.ipynb)** to explore the data, see how the models are trained, and make predictions. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.

1. **Review the Data:** Examine the provided Excel files **(Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx, Train Data.xlsx, and Test Data.xlsx)** to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

1. **Modify and Extend:** You can modify the Jupyter Notebook to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, or data visualization techniques to improve the prediction accuracy.

# Dataset Information

The dataset **(Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx)** likely contains information about students and various features related to their placement status. Common columns might include:

* First Name
* Email ID
* Ticket Type
* Attendee #
* Attendee Status
* College Name
* Designation
* Year of Graduation
* CGPA
* Speaking Skills
* ML Knowledge
* Placement Status (Target Variable: Placed/Not Placed)

Ensure that you understand the meaning of each column in the dataset before working with it.
